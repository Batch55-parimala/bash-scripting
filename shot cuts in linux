##To have shor cuts for any of the command that we are using n number of times we can short cut the command by using alias command.

1. for example " GIT PULL" we use the below command
    . alias gp="git pull" gp stand for git pull

## if we want to keep the short cut command alive even after signing off the terminal we can edit in bash profile and give the alias comman:
    . vim ~/.bash_profile (this need to be executed in the work station)
